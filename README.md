# Kanban

A simple kanban board to help you manage your daily tasks based on HTML5/JS with local storage.

## This project IS about:
* A simple kanban board to help a SINGLE person.
* Fixed 3-column kanban: To Do, Work In Progress, Done
* Lean task model: title, description and status.
* Tasks are stored on your browser cache.

## This project IS NOT about:
* IT IS NOT a flexible shared kanban board to help a team.
* YOU CAN'T customize the kanban (columns, colors, etc.).
* THERE's NO tools for managers such as statistics and graphs.

## Install instructions:

Just clone the project contents and run the index.html file with your favorite browser:

````
git clone http://github.com/rafaelodon/kanban
````

Since the kanban board data is cached under the URL you type, I strongly suggest you to clone it inside your Apache or Nginx public www folder (e.g. /var/www/kanban) and access it through your http server (e.g. http://localhost/kanban).
